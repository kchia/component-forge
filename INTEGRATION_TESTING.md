# Epic 11 - Tasks 12 & 13: Integration Testing Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Tasks 12 and 13 from Epic 11: Frontend-Backend Integration and Testing & Validation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Playwright E2E Test Infrastructure ✅

**Files Created:**
- `app/playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration with multi-browser support
- `app/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts` - Onboarding modal tests (TASK 13.4, 13.5)
- `app/e2e/token-extraction.spec.ts` - Token extraction integration tests (TASK 12.2-12.8, 13.1-13.3, 13.6)
- `app/e2e/fixtures/README.md` - Documentation for test fixtures

**Package.json Updates:**
Added E2E test scripts:
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run all E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Run in UI mode
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Run with visible browser
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` - Debug mode

### 2. Test Coverage

#### TASK 13.4 & 13.5: Onboarding Modal Tests (Fully Implemented) ✅

**File:** `app/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts`

Tests implemented:
- ✅ Modal shows on first visit
- ✅ Modal does NOT show on subsequent visits
- ✅ Workflow selection saves preference and navigates (Design System, Components, Figma)
- ✅ Skip button works correctly
- ✅ All workflow cards display with correct content
- ✅ Help text is visible

**Status:** Ready to run. These tests can execute immediately against the frontend.

#### TASK 12.2-12.8 & 13.1-13.3: Token Extraction Tests (Partially Implemented) 🚧

**File:** `app/e2e/token-extraction.spec.ts`

**TASK 12.7 & 13.6: Confidence Score Integration**
- ✅ UI ready for confidence badges
- 🚧 Badge color verification (requires backend data)
- 🚧 Threshold logic testing
- 🚧 Edge case handling (null, missing scores)

**TASK 12.8: Complete Integration Flows**
- 🚧 Screenshot: Upload → Extract → Edit → Export
- 🚧 Figma: Connect → Extract → Edit → Export
- 🚧 Performance test with large token sets

**TASK 13.3: TokenEditor Display**
- ✅ Page structure verified
- 🚧 Full component testing with real data

## How to Complete the Implementation

### Step 1: Add Test Fixtures

1. Create test images in `app/e2e/fixtures/`:
   ```bash
   # Add a design system screenshot
   # Name: design-system-sample.png
   # Requirements: PNG/JPEG, <10MB, shows colors/typography/spacing
   ```

2. Create `.env.test` in `app/` directory:
   ```bash
   TEST_FIGMA_PAT=your-figma-personal-access-token
   TEST_FIGMA_URL=https://www.figma.com/file/your-file-key/your-file-name
   PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Step 2: Start Backend Services

```bash
# Start all services (PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Redis, Backend, Frontend)
make dev

# Or manually:
docker-compose up -d
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn src.main:app --reload
cd app && npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Remove `.skip()` from Tests

Go through `app/e2e/token-extraction.spec.ts` and remove `.skip()` from tests one by one, updating selectors as needed based on actual UI implementation.

### Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/onboarding.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### Step 5: Verify Integration Checklist

From Epic 11 TASK 12.1:

- [ ] All 4 token categories flow from backend to frontend
- [ ] Semantic naming works (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- [ ] Confidence scores display correctly in all editors
- [ ] BorderRadius visual previews work
- [ ] Figma keyword matching functions correctly
- [ ] Export includes all new token fields
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Onboarding modal appears on first visit only

## Manual Testing Guide

While E2E tests are being completed, perform these manual tests:

### 1. Onboarding Flow
- [ ] Open app in incognito window
- [ ] Verify modal appears
- [ ] Click "Design System Screenshot" → Should navigate to /extract
- [ ] Refresh page → Modal should NOT appear again
- [ ] Clear localStorage → Modal should appear again

### 2. Screenshot Extraction
- [ ] Navigate to /extract
- [ ] Upload a design system screenshot
- [ ] Verify all 4 categories appear (colors, typography, spacing, borderRadius)
- [ ] Check semantic color names (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- [ ] Verify confidence badges appear with correct colors
- [ ] Edit a token value → Should update immediately

### 3. BorderRadius Editor
- [ ] After extraction, scroll to BorderRadius section
- [ ] Change a value (e.g., "md" from "6px" to "8px")
- [ ] Verify visual preview box updates with new border radius
- [ ] Verify confidence badge is visible

### 4. Export Functionality
- [ ] Click Export button
- [ ] Select JSON format
- [ ] Download and verify JSON contains:
  - colors (all semantic fields)
  - typography (font scale, weights, line heights)
  - spacing (xs through 3xl)
  - borderRadius (sm through full)
- [ ] Repeat with CSS format
- [ ] Verify CSS variables use semantic naming

### 5. Figma Extraction
- [ ] Switch to Figma tab
- [ ] Enter valid Figma PAT
- [ ] Enter Figma file URL
- [ ] Click Extract
- [ ] Verify semantic token mapping works
- [ ] Check that style names like "Primary/Blue" map to colors.primary

### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] Try uploading a PDF file → Should show error
- [ ] Try uploading a 20MB image → Should show error
- [ ] Disconnect backend and try extraction → Should show user-friendly error
- [ ] Clear a required token category → Should handle gracefully

### 7. Confidence Scores
- [ ] After extraction, check badge colors:
  - Green badges should be >0.9 confidence
  - Yellow badges should be 0.7-0.9 confidence
  - Red badges should be <0.7 confidence
- [ ] Hover over badges to see exact confidence value (if implemented)

## Test Results to Report

After running tests, document:

1. **Test Execution Summary:**
   - Total tests: X
   - Passed: Y
   - Failed: Z
   - Skipped: W

2. **Integration Checklist Results:**
   - Each item from TASK 12.1 checklist marked as ✅ or ❌

3. **Issues Found:**
   - Bug descriptions
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Screenshot extraction time
   - Figma extraction time
   - UI responsiveness with large token sets

## Known Limitations

1. **Skipped Tests**: Many tests in `token-extraction.spec.ts` are marked `.skip()` because they require:
   - Running backend with GPT-4V API key
   - Valid Figma credentials
   - Test fixture images

2. **Selector Brittleness**: Some selectors may need adjustment based on final UI implementation

3. **Backend Dependency**: Full integration tests require all services running (PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Redis)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mock Backend**: Create a mock backend for faster testing without external dependencies
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add visual snapshots for UI components
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Integrate axe-core for automated a11y checks
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance benchmarks for extraction times
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up GitHub Actions workflow to run tests automatically

   - **Status**: Expected increase, no issue

2. **Internal Links** 
   - Found: 117 unique internal markdown links
   - **Action**: Manual verification needed to ensure all targets exist
   - **Phase**: Phase 8 of execution guide

3. **External Links**
   - Found: 139 unique external URLs
   - **Action**: Spot check critical external resources
   - **Phase**: Phase 8 of execution guide

4. **Port Numbers**
   Sample findings:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000  (Frontend - documented)
   http://localhost:8000  (Backend - documented)
   http://localhost:6006  (Storybook - mentioned)
   ```
   - **Action**: Verify all port references are consistent
   - **Phase**: Phase 2.4 and Phase 6.5

5. **Version References**
   Sample findings:
   ```
   Next.js:
   - "Next.js 15.5.4" (multiple mentions)
   
   React:
   - "React 19" (multiple mentions)
   - "React 19.1.0" (package.json)
   
   Python:
   - "Python 3.11+" (multiple mentions)
   ```
   - **Action**: Verify consistency across all documentation
   - **Phase**: Phase 9

## How to Interpret the Output

### Section 1: Documentation Inventory
Shows all markdown files in `docs/` (excluding archives). Use this to:
- Confirm all docs are accounted for
- Identify any missing or unexpected files
- Cross-reference with the plan

### Section 2: Code Structure
Lists actual backend structure. Use this to:
- Compare with documented architecture
- Identify undocumented modules
- Verify module counts match expectations

### Section 3: API Endpoints
Extracts endpoint references from code. Use this to:
- Compare with API documentation
- Find undocumented endpoints
- Verify HTTP methods match

### Section 4: Port Numbers
Finds all port references. Use this to:
- Ensure consistency across docs
- Verify against docker-compose.yml
- Check for typos or outdated ports

### Section 5: Version References
Extracts version mentions. Use this to:
- Spot version inconsistencies
- Verify against package.json/requirements.txt
- Update outdated version references

### Section 6: Internal Links
Lists all `[text](./path)` links. Use this to:
- Verify link targets exist
- Check for broken relative paths
- Update moved or renamed files

### Section 7: External Links
Lists all HTTP/HTTPS URLs. Use this to:
- Test critical external resources
- Update dead links
- Verify third-party documentation

### Section 8: UI Components
Compares documented vs implemented. Use this to:
- Find missing components
- Identify undocumented components
- Verify component library completeness

### Section 9: Service Layer
Lists actual service files. Use this to:
- Compare with architecture docs
- Verify all services documented
- Check service descriptions

### Section 10: Deprecated Modules
Checks for removed modules. Use this to:
- Confirm Epic 4.5 refactor complete
- Verify deprecation documentation accurate
- Identify any lingering old code

## Reference Files Created

After running the script, check these files in `/tmp/doc-review/`:

1. **`automated-checks-output.txt`**
   - Full output of all checks
   - Use as baseline reference
   - Compare against findings document

2. **`doc-inventory.txt`**
   - List of all documentation files
   - One file per line with full path
   - Use for systematic review

3. **`internal-links.txt`**
   - All internal markdown links found
   - Format: `[text](./path)`
   - Use for link validation

4. **`external-links.txt`**
   - All external URLs found
   - One URL per line
   - Use for external link checking

---

## Next Steps After Running Checks

1. **Review the Output**
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/doc-review/automated-checks-output.txt
   ```

2. **Start Phase 1**
   - Open `DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
   - Follow Step 1.2: Use the code structure mapping
   - Follow Step 1.3: Gap analysis

3. **Begin Manual Verification**
   - Compare documented endpoints with actual code
   - Verify version numbers in package files
   - Test sample internal links
   - Check critical external links

4. **Record Findings**
   - Use `DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md`
   - Fill in appropriate finding IDs
   - Note severity and recommendations

---

## Expected Runtime

- **Script execution**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Output review**: ~15-30 minutes
- **Initial analysis**: ~1-2 hours
- **Full manual review**: 8-14 hours (per plan)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script Errors

**Issue**: "find: warning: you have specified the global option -maxdepth after the argument -type"
- **Impact**: Minor warning, does not affect results
- **Fix**: Reorder find command arguments (already noted for improvement)

**Issue**: "Permission denied" on script
- **Fix**: `chmod +x docs/scripts/automated-doc-checks.sh`

**Issue**: Output files not created
- **Fix**: Check `/tmp/doc-review/` directory exists and is writable

### Interpreting Results

**Many external links found**: This is normal - includes all HTTP/HTTPS URLs in docs and README
**117 internal links**: This is reasonable for 41 documentation files (~3 links per file)
**41 vs 36 files**: Expected - includes the 5 new review framework files

---

## Integration with CI/CD (Future Enhancement)

The automated script can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Documentation Check
  run: |
    bash docs/scripts/automated-doc-checks.sh
    # Parse output for critical issues
    # Fail build if critical discrepancies found
```

Potential enhancements:
- Link validation (check if targets exist)
- Version extraction and comparison
- Code example syntax checking
- Port number consistency validation
- Generate HTML report with clickable links

---

## Summary

The automated checks provide a **solid baseline** for the documentation review:
- âœ… Quick execution (5-10 seconds)
- âœ… Comprehensive coverage (10 different checks)
- âœ… Actionable outputs (reference files for manual review)
- âœ… Identifies key areas needing attention

Use this as the starting point, then proceed with the manual verification phases outlined in the execution guide.

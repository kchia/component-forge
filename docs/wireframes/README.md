# ComponentForge Wireframes

This directory contains wireframes for the ComponentForge application, documenting the user interface and user flows for the AI-powered design-to-code component generation system.

## Wireframe Organization

### Core User Flows

1. **01-upload-design.md** - Design input (screenshot/Figma)
2. **02-token-extraction.md** - Design token extraction and review
3. **03-requirement-proposal.md** - AI-generated requirement approval
4. **04-pattern-selection.md** - Pattern retrieval and selection
5. **05-code-generation.md** - Component generation and preview
6. **06-quality-validation.md** - Quality checks and fixes
7. **07-export-integration.md** - Export and integrate generated code
8. **08-dashboard.md** - Main dashboard and project overview
9. **09-settings.md** - User settings and configuration

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear primary actions (CTAs)
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Contextual help and guidance

### Accessibility First
- WCAG AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast focus indicators

### Component Library
- shadcn/ui components as foundation
- Radix UI primitives for advanced interactions
- Lucide React icons for consistency
